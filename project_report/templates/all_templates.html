    <h3>Read Mapping and Duplicates</h3>
    <img id="chart2" class="charts" src="{{ params['mapping_duplicates_chart'] }}" />
    <p class="justify_text">Optical and PCR duplicates can be generated during library preparation, clustering, or be due to
    sample quality. The percentage of duplicates is calculated by comparing the number of duplicate reads
    to the total read count. Duplicates are identified during read mapping to prevent the overestimation
    of coverage, therefore, the percentage of paired reads aligned to the reference genome includes
    non-duplicate reads only. A duplicate rate of < 30% is required for each sample, except in circumstances
    where a very high yield achieves sufficient coverage of the genome despite a high duplicate rate.</p>

    <h3>Fastq</h3>
    <p class="justify_text">Files ending in 'fastq.gz' are in gzipped Sanger fastq format, and contain the raw sequence data after

    the first and second reads of each read pair.</p>

    <p class="justify_text">Files ending in '.bam' are in BAM format, and contain the reads aligned to the genome and ready for
    variant calling. Each sample has one BAM file plus a '.bam.bai' file, which is the BAM index. This
    allows some programmes fast random access to any part of the BAM file.</p>

    <p class="justify_text">Files ending in '.vcf.gz' are gzipped VCF files, and contain variants dectected between the sample and
    the reference genome. There is also a 'g.vcf.gz' file, which contains genotype likelihoods across the
    genome regardless of the presence of a variant. Files ending in 'vcf.gz.tbi' are Tabix indexes
    allowing fast random access to any part of their corresponding VCF.</p>

    <h3>Sample QC</h3>
    <p  class="font5">Genomic DNA (gDNA) samples are evaluated for quantity using Quant-iT Picogren reagent, Lambda Standard DNA
    and a Molecular Devices, Spectramax XPS Gemini plate reader.  The quality of the gDNA samples are evaluated
    using an AATI Fragment Analyzer and the Standard Sensitivity Genomic DNA Analysis Kit. Genomic DNA samples
    found to have a total amount of >1000ng and a quality score >5 pass sample QC. Based on the quantification results,
    gDNA samples are pre-normalised to fall within the 5-40ng/uL concentration range required for Illumina SeqLab
